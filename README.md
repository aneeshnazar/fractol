# fractol

The goal of this project was to draw a series of fractals - namely, the Julia set, the Mandelbrot set, 
and a third fractal of our choice (I chose the Burning Ship set).

## How to

Clone the repo, make, and run using the command line `./fractol` followed by whatever fractol you'd like to see - `julia` for
the Julia set, `mandelbrot` for the mandelbrot set, and `bship` for the burning ship set. Use the arrow keys to navigate,
mouse wheel to zoom in and out, and `-` and `+` to decrease or increase the number of iterations, respectively.
